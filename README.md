## Description of the Alexa Skill
Battle at Sea is based on a classic battleship game, and is a game for two players on a 10 x 10 grid with a five-ship fleet each. Alexa acts as a mediator. Alexa finds you an opponent in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia or India.

Fleet consists of:
- aircraft carrier (5 cells)
- battleship (4 cells)
- cruiser (3 cells)
- destroyer (2 cells)
- submarine (1 cell)

Place ships by giving Alexa:
- row (1-10)
- column (1-10)
- direction (up, down, left, right)

Each player takes a turn to fire by providing Alexa with:
- row (1-10)
- column (1-10)

- Open Battle at Sea
- Play Battle at Sea
- Start Battle at Sea
